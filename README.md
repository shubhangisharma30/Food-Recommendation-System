# Food Recommendation System🍱

This is a machine learning web software that allows the user to select a meal item based on personal preferences before receiving ten further suggestions for comparable foods. To do the same, our solution makes use of item-based collaborative filtering. We provide a selection of cuisines, including vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.

- Options are available for vegetarians and non-vegetarians.
- The user has a selection of cuisines to choose from.
- The user can modify the rating system.
- Ten food items related to the user's initial selection are suggested by our algorithm.
